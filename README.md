# soundbytes
Sound effects and music related hardware (in Chisel)

# Next Steps

* Create a Hello World example
  * Create a simple sound sample (a kind of pop)
  * Apply a simple effect e.g., delay
  * Write a .wav file
  * All in Chisel simulation
* Look into related work, what is available in open source
* Add recording and playback on a PC for the simulation
* Get the Hello Wrld running in an FPGA
* Get audio IO running in an FPGA
  * AC97 AD/DA converter
  * Simple sigma-delta IO
* Make it a project for students at DTU
